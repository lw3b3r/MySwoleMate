Instructions
Create 2 methods within the TraineeBLL class in the solution.

These 2 methods will do the following

Create a private method called HeightDisplay which takes in an int value. The HeightDisplay method will calculate the total int value of inches into feet and inches (so 67 value should return "5 ft. 7 in."). You will use a combination of operators and string concatenation.

Create another private method called PhoneDisplay which takes in a string value, and returns a string value with hyphens "-" in between the area code and phone number (1234567890 should return 123-456-7890)
You will then use these methods in order to store the HeightDisplay and PhoneDisplay properties within the TraineeViewModel. If you look at the TraineeBLL under the comments you will see where you need to apply these methods. 

For help, view the Data Types, Strings, and Operators videos for calculations. Also you will need to review the Loops video to traverse through each trainee that returns from the GetTrainees() method.
